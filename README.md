# Homework folders for C++ course

This is a dummy repository with the structure for the homeworks.

Your task is to fill the appropriate homeworks with your solutions to the given
homework sheets.

## Structure is important

We will only be able to test the homework if the structure of the project is
going to be **exactly** correct. Every homework will define a structure of the
folders that you will need to follow. If the structure is unclear to you, ask
you tutor for help.

## Results of the tests

Every time you push to this repository, the automatic tests check your code.

Once the pipeline has finished you will be able to find the results of your
homework on the **Wiki** page of your fork of this repository.

To see the Wiki, click the `Wiki` tab on the left of the page in your
repository.

## Be patient

It will take some time to check your code. Please refresh the wiki page until
you see an update there. If you see no update within approx. 5 minutes there,
contact your tutor, something might be broken.

## !!! DO NOT DEBUG WITH WIKI !!!

Do not use this machinery as a debug tool. Make sure your code compiles and runs
on your local machine. Write unit tests on your local machine when needed. Do
not just resubmit the code here after every little fix you made. It will amount
to quite a lot of lost time and a frustrating experience overall as the builds
might take up to a couple of minutes versus just seconds on your local machine.
